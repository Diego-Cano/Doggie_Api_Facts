# Doggie_Api_Facts
Assignment for my Web app class

-API documentation explaining how to use endpoints:

  The Doggie_Api_Facts API retrieves its information as JSON on a browser window. You can see it by running http://localhost:3000/facts on your server. It will show you all of the facts available in the dog_facts.js file. Also, you can retrieve individual elements by running (http://localhost:3000/facts?number=3) and you may substitute the number 3 with the desired fact number.

- Challenges faced and decision-making:

  The biggest challenge I faced was figuring out what was wrong with my code. I had to change my server.js extension to 'mjs', so It could work with the dog_facts.js file. Also, I learned how to enable ES6 module support for my Node.js project. I just had to add "type": "module" in my package.json.

 However, as per your request to keep the dog_facts.js unchanged, you'll likely want to enable ES6 module support in your Node.js project.
